# Unilink
Unilink GUI System. Developed in Java. 
This project was done as a requirement for the course Advanced Programming under Master of Data Science at RMIT.
The requirement was to develop a GUI for hypothetical students in a university to create different types of posts 
such as Event, Job or Sale posts, to reply to someone elses post, give proper error messages when needed, add these to a hslqb 
database in a database schema, export event details to a textfile, etc. The filtering of posts are only done according to 
post type, need to update the code in order to enable other filter types as well as import from a text file. 

Made using intellij idea with help of Scene Builder. Java JDK 11 version.
